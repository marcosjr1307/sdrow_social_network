# Literary social network  

</div>

### About the repository
This repository contains the web version of a social network developed for my school(COTIL) TCC. 🖥  <br>

### About SDROW
The social network named Sdrow (means 'words' backwards) is a part of my TCC.
I developed, in addition to this web version:
- **DESKTOP**: A software that controls our database (not yet public). 💾
- **MOBILE**: The same social network, but for smartphones (not yet public). 📱

### What's the idea of developing a social network?
Throughout some research carried out it was noticied that the number of readers, specifically in Brazil, is decreasing. 📉  <br>
So I decided (w/ my group) to create an environment where the users can gradually approach literature in a relaxed way, like on social media. 👨🏻‍💻  <br>
With Sdrow users can make posts to show:
- Parts of book 📖
- Poems 📜
- Songs lyrcis 🎼
- Designs 🖼️
- Phrases 📑
- Images about movies, books, series... 🎞️ <br>
  
and more other things, that other users can:


- Like posts 💙
- Comment on posts ☁️
- Follow users 👥
- See profile of the users ℹ️
- See posts made by users 📰
- See posts liked by users 💙 <br>

💡***It's all like a social media, but it's a literature-focused environment!*** 📚

 ### Technologies used
 When I started coding the social media I didn't have knowledge of more interesting programming languages, so I decided to use PHP. <br>
 I was going to use [laravel](https://laravel.com/), but I decided to use a framework that I found arround the internet called [JetPHP](https://github.com/jetphp), created by a developer named [Joao Artur](https://github.com/JoaoArtur). <br>
 The framework was simple and had some issues, but I changed some parts of it and used it to create the social media!
 **Technologies:**
 - PHP
 - AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
 - MySQL
 - HTML/CSS (without frameworks)
 - Composer
 - MVC Structure (Model-View-Controller)
